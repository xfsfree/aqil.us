                        <p>Land Rover was founded in <strong>1948</strong> by the Rover Company in the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The company started by making tough vehicles for farmers and workers.</p>
                        <p>These early vehicles were simple but extremely reliable and capable.</p>
                        <p>They became famous for their ability to work in harsh conditions.</p>
                        <p>The success of these early Land Rovers laid the foundation for something greater.</p>
                        <p>The company dreamed of creating a luxury vehicle with the same toughness.</p>
                        <p>This vision would eventually lead to the creation of Range Rover.</p>

                        <p>Early SUVs like the <strong>Jeep Wagoneer</strong> and <strong>Land Rover Series</strong> were very basic.</p>
                        <p>They had simple interiors with plastic dashboards and cloth seats.</p>
                        <p>The rides were rough and bumpy even on normal roads.</p>
                        <p>These vehicles were made for military operations and farming work.</p>
                        <p>Comfort and luxury were not priorities for these early models.</p>
                        <p>They were practical tools rather than status symbols.</p>
                        <p>Most people would not drive them to fancy places or events.</p>
                        <p>Range Rover would soon change all of this with its revolutionary approach.</p>

                        <p>In <strong>1970</strong>, something revolutionary happened in the automotive world.</p>
                        <p>Two brilliant engineers, <strong>Charles Spencer King</strong> and <strong>Gordon Bashford</strong>, created the first Range Rover.</p>
                        <p>Charles Spencer King was the chief engineer who led the technical development.</p>
                        <p>Gordon Bashford designed the iconic boxy shape that became legendary.</p>
                        <p>They wanted to build a vehicle that combined luxury car comfort with off-road power.</p>
                        <p>The first Range Rover had a powerful V8 engine and permanent four-wheel drive.</p>
                        <p>It featured coil spring suspension which was revolutionary for SUVs at that time.</p>
                        <p>The launch in June 1970 changed the automotive industry forever.</p>
                        <p>For the first time, an SUV could be driven to fancy events and rough terrain equally well.</p>

                        <p>Range Rover is not just a luxury vehicle - it is one of the <strong>most capable off-road SUVs</strong> ever made.</p>

                        <p>It can wade through water up to <strong>900mm (35 inches)</strong> deep without any problems.</p>
                        <p>The air suspension can raise the vehicle for extreme ground clearance on rough terrain.</p>
                        <p>Electronic traction control sends power to the wheels with the most grip instantly.</p>
                        <p>Range Rover can climb steep hills, descend dangerous slopes, and cross challenging obstacles.</p>
                        <p>While other luxury SUVs struggle off-road, Range Rover excels in the toughest conditions.</p>
                        <p>This legendary capability is what separates Range Rover from all other luxury vehicles.</p>

                        <p>Range Rover offers <strong>incredible luxury and capability</strong>, but ownership comes with challenges.</p>
                        <p>The purchase price is very high, starting over <strong>$100,000</strong> and reaching <strong>$200,000+</strong> fully equipped.</p>
                        <p>Maintenance costs are significantly higher than regular SUVs due to complex systems and premium parts.</p>
                        <p>Range Rovers are known for <strong>frequent repairs</strong> especially with electrical systems and air suspension.</p>
                        <p>The air suspension system can fail and costs <strong>$2,000-$5,000</strong> per corner to replace.</p>
                        <p>Electrical problems with sensors, screens, and control modules are common after a few years.</p>
                        <p>Fuel consumption is high with V8 engines averaging only <strong>15-18 MPG</strong> in real-world driving.</p>
                        <p>Insurance premiums are expensive due to high repair costs and theft rates.</p>
                        <p>Despite these issues, owners accept the costs because Range Rover offers unmatched prestige and capability.</p>
                        <p>For those who can afford it, Range Rover remains the ultimate luxury SUV experience.</p>
